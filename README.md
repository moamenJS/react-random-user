# react-random-user

Hi Moamen Medleg,
Hope you are well.

Following our conversation, please find the coding task instructions:

Create a page with a title “All users” with a table of users which will contain the following columns:
Picture (circled icon)
Full name (first letter of first name and last name)
Email (link to send the user new email)
Gender
Age

Table should have pagination control, synced with the api pagination:
Every page should fetch and contain 10 rows .
Add controls to move between pages

Add search input to the table, the search should be based on any of the following parameters : name, email, age.

When clicking on a user row, move to another page with a title “User Details” and show the same data from the table, also show the user address on a map with a pin. Page url should contain the username.

***Make sure to support refreshing the page inside the user details page***


General Notes:

Use this free API service to get all the data you need : https://randomuser.me/documentation
(pay attention to use a constant seed in order to get the same data)
** you should write the client side only! **

The pages should be created by using a design library as material design for example or without any.
Make sure the pages is fully responsive.
Please use React or Angular to build the app.

Bonus:
Add sorters to table columns
