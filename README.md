Every page should fetch and contain 10 rows .
Add controls to move between pages

Add search input to the table, the search should be based on any of the following parameters : name, email, age.

When clicking on a user row, move to another page with a title “User Details” and show the same data from the table, also show the user address on a map with a pin. Page url should contain the username.

(pay attention to use a constant seed in order to get the same data)
** you should write the client side only! **

The pages should be created by using a design library as material design for example or without any.
